  <hr />
  <span class=myClass> It all began one fateful January afternoon. I was on my way to pick out a golden retriver from a litter of puppies to be my future faithful companion. However little did I know that instead waiting for me was a puppy who was going to pick out me as her future best friend. I arrived at the house where I was going to choose my puppy. I spent some time with them all and finally had made my choice. I was on my way to leave with my mind made up that I was going to wait for now when suddenly I felt a tugging at my shoe. A golden I had not noticed as much before was tugging at my shoe laces, and demanding I took her with me. I looked into her eyes, and she begged back with those big puppy eyes, and I couldn't believe it. This puppy had choosen me and in the end I choose her. So I brought her home. Now she is turning three and she is the happiest dog I have ever known.</span><br />
